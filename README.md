notes
=====

These are my live-TeX'd (and occasionally later edited) lecture notes for some of the courses that I'm taking/have taken.
There will inevitably be mistakes and formatting issues and stuff -- I'm not the best TeX-er in the universe, so please point mistakes out to me!
Note also that the basically the only reason I started TeXing is because my notebook ran out of pages... so some of the notes might start from the middle of the course.
