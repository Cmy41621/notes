notes
=====

This repository is an eclectic collection of my notes on various subjects, taken either live during lecture, or typed up offline.
Most of these are woefully incomplete and contain only a few lectures. Indeed, the only *real* notes, in any sense, are live-TeX'd in
Prof. Mu-Tao Wang's differentiable manifolds course (stored in "diffman/"), and those for Contemporary Civilizations, a philosophy course,
(in philosophy/, when I'm not dozing off, oops).

Disclaimer: there are most certainly mistakes littered throughout these notes. If you notice something untoward, please let me know!

TODO soon:
* Fill in missing parts of the manifolds lectures on bump/cutoff functions
* Prettify the parentheses throughout the notes
* Figure out how to do evaluated at prettier than with a pipe

TODO later (i.e. summer break):
* Work through the representation theory notes and TeX them up
* Add in diagrams for manifolds via TikZ at the end of the semester
* TeX up algebra II lectures (offline: Friedman is rather unstructured)
