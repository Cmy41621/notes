notes
=====

This repository contains a handful of live-TeX'd lecture notes, problem sets (both solved and unsolved), more informal expository notes-to-self, etc.
None of the notes, however, are particularly detailed or complete, so beware.

There may well be numerous mistakes and typos. Please feel free to point them out to me or to fix them yourself.
