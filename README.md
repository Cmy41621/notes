notes
=====

These are my live-TeX'd (and occasionally later edited) lecture notes for some of the courses that I'm taking/have taken.
There will inevitably be mistakes and formatting issues and stuff -- I'm not the best TeX-er in the universe, so please point mistakes out to me!

Note: there are only a few lectures worth of complex notes. Additionally, topology/ contains my self-taught notes on very basic topology.
