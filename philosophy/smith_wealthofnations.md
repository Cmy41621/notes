Notes on: Smith's *Wealth of Nations*
========================================

## Raw notes ##

* Division of labor greatly increases productivity; the most "opulent nations" are usually those that
have the furthest division of labor, both inter-occupational and intra-occupational
* Agriculture is typically hard to divide labor in, and thus even well-off nations have much more advanced
manufacturing than agriculture (in proportion)
* Division of labor increases productivity because:
    1. "increase of dexterity in every particular workman"
    2. "the saving of the time which is commonly lost in passing from one species of work to another"
    3. "the invention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge labour, and enable one man
        to do the work of many."
* Such division of labor leads to "a general plenty [that] diffuses itself through all the different ranks
of the society" (p.12)
* The adoption of the division of labor was not originally a conscious choice -- instead it comes from the
human propensity to barter and exchange.
* Humans are all dependent on each other in civilized society, but not for the sake of benevolence only;
much of it comes from self-interest
