Notes on: Rousseau's *Discourse on the Origin of Inequality* and *On the Social Contract*
========================================

## Raw notes ##

* Two kinds of inequality: natural/physical and moral/political
* Humans, stripped of all "artificialities" share traits with animals, but are much better organized
* Man is able to learn much better than animals; this is why man is more successful at survival
* There is a distinct difference between "savage man" and man in a state of nature
    * the state of nature is purely philosophical and may never have actually existed
* Animals operate on pure instinct, whereas humans are "free" of nature's yoke (again, to learn)
* Humans thus have "free will" and a capacity for **perfectibility** (progress throughout life)
* Humans reason only when possessed with a desire for knowledge that originates from a need to be satisfied
    * those in the state of nature are never in this situation
* As humans in the state of nature are as a whole, rather solitary, how would knowledge even have passed through the species?
* Languages likely could not have formed until humans settled into stable communities, after having left the state of nature
* Since humans in nature are solitary, relationships are fleeting, not, as Aristotle might say, a political animal
* In the state of nature, in some sense, virtue and vice are meaningless; men are not miserable in any sense of the term
    * misery, depression, etc. comes about only in society
* Man has no idea of right and wrong, good or bad; thus, man in the state of nature is neither good nor evil
* Man in the state of nature is filled with **amour propre**, the desire for self-preservation
* Amour propre is tempered by an "innate repugnance to seeing his fellowmen suffer" - **pity**
    * Pity is so universal that even animals show it
* It is reason that often blocks out pity, philosophy that persuades him to rationalize
    * Pity takes the place of laws, etc. in the state of nature
* This hypothethical seems to suggest that even "natural" inequality has negligible effect in the state of nature

## My questions ##

* Rousseau is often careful to distinguish between those who do not live in the style of Western civilization and those
    who live in the state of nature (solitary, with little to no language, etc.). He forcefully asserts that while aboriginal "savages"
    certainly do exist, it is only pure speculation, pure hypothesis, that humans ever existed in the state of nature. However, throughout 
    many of his arguments, doesn't Rousseau break this rule? Especially since when he muses about how language and other such abstract, civilized
    constructs, he imagines a slow transition from the state of nature into civil life.

## Class notes ##

* Hume and Rousseau:
    * both give man, in his natural state, some form of beneficience/pity/compassion
    * Rousseau is rather anti-Enlightenment - he claims that civilization corrupts man from his natural state,
        whereas Hume very much buys into the narrative of progress
* By Rousseau's time, Geneva had "degraded" somewhat, so to speak - only very few, rather rich people held power. It had
    turned into a Protestant oligarchy, almost
* His writing has a general theme that man began as good, but become evil through the emergence of a rationalized structure of humans
    that we call "civilization"
    * In this sense, his philosophy is quite opposite to those that came before him, likely due to his biographical experiences
* We come into life with equipment to live life happily, but when wrongly used, can lead us into misery
* Rousseau focuses on desire, not obligations or rights or property, very different than others we have read
