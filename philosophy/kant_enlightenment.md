Notes on: Immanuel Kant's *[What is Enlightenment?](http://www.columbia.edu/acis/ets/CCREAD/etscc/kant.html)*
========================================

## Raw notes ##

* Enlightenment is man's ability to use one's own understanding: "Have the courage to use your own understanding"
* Nonage, the abscence of enlightenment is caused by indecision/lack of courage/laziness
* There are "guardians" (pastors, etc.) who depict enlightenment as dangerous, and discourage it
* In truth, the danger is not all too great, if one is willing to make a few mistakes in order to learn
* If the public is given freedom, enlightenment is almost inevitable - the few free thinkers would spread
    "a reasonable appreciation of man's value and of his duty to think for himself"
* However, now the guardians would be vengefully oppressed, creating a new unthinking mass, slowing enlightenment
* The catalyst for enlightenment is freedom, the freedom to "make public use of one's reason in all matters"
* Arguing vs. obeying
* Public use of reason is the use of reason before a reading public
* Private use of reason is that used in "a civic post that has been entrusted to him"
* The primary difference between the two is that, in private use, one must not argue (soldier must not argue about
    his orders) whereas a scholar has every right to point out the mistakes of the military, etc.)
* Main example: a pastor, as a scholar, should be free to convey his personal thoughts on the church's teachings,
    even his misgivings. Indeed, for if his misgivings contradict the dogma outright, he would resign as a pastor
* Religious orders do not have the right to establish their doctrines as unalterable (done, of course, to perpetuate
    power and control). It is "null and void" that some should keep others from increasing their own insights,
    removing errors, etc. Indeed "that would be a crime against human nature whose proper destiny lies precisely
    in such progress"
* People should not impose upon themselves laws (or restrictions) that impedes critique, and thus "progress"
* A ruler has no say in the personal religious freedoms of man, as long as they line up with civil order
    "Caesar non est supra grammaticos"
* Are we living in an enlightened age? No, but we live in one of enlightenment: "the hindrances against
    general enlightenment or the emergence from self-imposed nonage are gradually diminishing"
* Emphasis on enlightenment from the perspective of religion, as the arts and sciences are not typically
    "guarded"
* A high degree of civic and intellectual freedom fosters free thought, which allows man to be treated
    "in accord with his dignity"

## Quotes ##

> Laziness and cowardice are the reasons why such a large part of mankind gladly remain minors all their lives,
long after nature has freed them from external guidance... it is so comfortable to be a minor.

> Dogmas and formulas, these mechanical tools designed for reasonable use - or rather abuse - of his natural
gifts, are the fetters of an everlasting nonage... this is why there are only a few men who walk firmly, and
who have emerged from nonage by cultivating their own minds.

> A revolution may bring about the end of a personal despotism or of avaricious tyrannical oppression, but
never a true reform of modes of thought. New prejudices will serve, in place of the old, as guidelines
for the unthinking multitude.

> That the spiritual guardians of the people should themselves be treated as minors is an absurdity which would
result in perpetuating absurdities.

> But to agree to a perpetual religious constitution which is not publicly questioned by anyone would be, as it
were, to annihilate a period of time in the progress of man's improvement. This must be absolutely forbidden.

> Salvation is none of [the ruler's] business; it *is* his business to prevent one man from forcibly keeping
another from determining and promoting his salvation to the best of his ability.

> When one does not deliberately attempt to keep men in barbarism, they will gradually work out of that condition
by themselves

> Nature, then, has carefully cultivated... the urge for and the vocation of free thought... at last free thought
acts even on the fundamentals of government and the state finds it agreeable to treat man, who is now more than a
machine, in accord with his dignity.
