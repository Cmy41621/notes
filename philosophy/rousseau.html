<h1>Notes on: Rousseau's <em>Discourse on the Origin of Inequality</em> and <em>On the Social Contract</em></h1>

<h2>Raw notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Two kinds of inequality: natural/physical and moral/political</li>
<li>Humans, stripped of all "artificialities" share traits with animals, but are much better organized</li>
<li>Man is able to learn much better than animals; this is why man is more successful at survival</li>
<li>There is a distinct difference between "savage man" and man in a state of nature
<ul>
<li>the state of nature is purely philosophical and may never have actually existed</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Animals operate on pure instinct, whereas humans are "free" of nature's yoke (again, to learn)</li>
<li>Humans thus have "free will" and a capacity for <strong>perfectibility</strong> (progress throughout life)</li>
<li>Humans reason only when possessed with a desire for knowledge that originates from a need to be satisfied
<ul>
<li>those in the state of nature are never in this situation</li>
</ul></li>
<li>As humans in the state of nature are as a whole, rather solitary, how would knowledge even have passed through the species?</li>
<li>Languages likely could not have formed until humans settled into stable communities, after having left the state of nature</li>
<li>Since humans in nature are solitary, relationships are fleeting, not, as Aristotle might say, a political animal</li>
<li>In the state of nature, in some sense, virtue and vice are meaningless; men are not miserable in any sense of the term
<ul>
<li>misery, depression, etc. comes about only in society</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Man has no idea of right and wrong, good or bad; thus, man in the state of nature is neither good nor evil</li>
<li>Man in the state of nature is filled with <strong>amour propre</strong>, the desire for self-preservation</li>
<li>Amour propre is tempered by an "innate repugnance to seeing his fellowmen suffer" - <strong>pity</strong>
<ul>
<li>Pity is so universal that even animals show it</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It is reason that often blocks out pity, philosophy that persuades him to rationalize
<ul>
<li>Pity takes the place of laws, etc. in the state of nature</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This hypothethical seems to suggest that even "natural" inequality has negligible effect in the state of nature</li>
<li>Social order is a "sacred right"</li>
<li>The oldest and most natural social order is that of the family -- ever after children grow up, they often agree
voluntarily to remain united with the family; thus, the family is the prototype of political society</li>
<li>No one is born with the nature of a slave; all are born equal. It is simply circumstance of experience that governs
the "nature" - unlike Aristotle's claim that we are born to be dominating/dominated.</li>
<li>Force/power is independent of moral "right"; "one is obliged to obey only legitimate powers"
<ul>
<li>thus, <strong>agreements</strong> alone are the basis of legitimate authority among men</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The nature of man bids that man do not renounce his liberty</li>
<li>Men transition out of the natural state when they can no longer fend for themselves
<ul>
<li>men can only form aggregates to gain the upper hand against their obstacles</li>
<li>but how shall men trust each other without getting hurt?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Rousseau poses this problem as: "Find a form of association that defends and protexts with all common forces the person and goods of each associate,
and, by means of which, each one, while uniting with all, nevertheless obeys himself and remains as free as before."</li>
<li>The solution lies in the <strong>social contract</strong>
<ul>
<li>"Each of us places his person and all his power in common under the supreme direction of the general will;
and as one, we receive each member as an indivisible part of the whole."</li>
<li>the contract produces a collective moral body, a <strong>body politic</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li>A single sovereign in some sense contradicts the spirit of a collective society; the sovereign is thus the <strong>power</strong> of the body itself</li>
<li>Those who go against the spirit of the body would reduce the social compact to an "empty formula," and thus such members should
be expelled (maybe? a bit confused about this paragraph?)</li>
<li>A member of the state surrenders himself and his property to the state in the sense that the state's ownership has precedent
<ul>
<li>there is, however, the right of the first occupant, which commands the respect of other men</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The will of the body politic can never be completely affixed to that of a citizen, as private and public wills, while they may align
for a brief time, will inevitably diverge</li>
<li>Sovereignty is indivisble: "either the will is general or it is not"</li>
<li>Political theorists who divide sovereignty into separate powers violate this principle, and lead themselves to inconsistencies</li>
<li>"The general will is always right and always tends toward the public utility" but we can often be tricked
<ul>
<li>there are often differences between the general will and the will of all - the latter is merely the sum of private wills</li>
<li>once there are those left out from the body, the will becomes simply a collective private opinion and no longer a general will</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>My questions</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Rousseau is often careful to distinguish between those who do not live in the style of Western civilization and those
who live in the state of nature (solitary, with little to no language, etc.). He forcefully asserts that while aboriginal "savages"
certainly do exist, it is only pure speculation, pure hypothesis, that humans ever existed in the state of nature. However, throughout 
many of his arguments, doesn't Rousseau break this rule? Especially since when he muses about how language and other such abstract, civilized
constructs, he imagines a slow transition from the state of nature into civil life.</p></li>
<li><p>Rousseau never seems to discuss the intellectual aspect of mankind, only the physical and moral aspects. Take for example, his conception of war:
"Men are not naturally enemies... It is the relationship between things and not that between men that brings abour war... a private war between one man
and another can exist neither in the state of nature, where there is no constant property, nor in the social state, where everything is under the
authority of laws." (SC, Ch. 3, paragraph 11) What about philosophical/intellectual/religious  struggles/arguments between humans? Are they not 
private wars, wars that are largely independent of material wealth? In fact, Rousseau doesn't seem to discuss intellect/wisdom much at all.
He simply states that they are not present in the state of nature (as such high-brow thinking has little immediate utility), but doesn't intellect
go against his theme of society corrupting the state of nature? With greater intellect, life can be much improved, and these improvements
cannot come about in the state of nature. Do the downsides of intellectual thinking/research outweigh the benefits? Although Rousseau
<em>does</em> mention language, etc. as intellectual improvements, so perhaps Rousseau believes that intellectual advancements lead to society,
which inevitably leads to unhappiness through the corruption of the natural state.</p></li>
<li><p>In chapter 6 of social contract, Rousseau introduces the formation of government as: "I suppose that men have reached the point where obstacles
that are harmful to their maintenance in the state of nature gain the upper hand by their resistance to the forces that each invididual
can bring to bear to maintain himself in that state. Such being the case, that original state cannot subsist any longer, and the human race
would perish if it did not alter its mode of existence." Why would such a point every be reached? In Rousseau's description of the state
of human nature, it seems as if, though life may not be easy, it is certainly not harsh to the point that one can no longer fend for one's
self. Would society then come about only through the occurence of a natural disaster/evil-monkey-invasion or some such <em>external</em> force?</p></li>
<li><p>What does Rousseau mean in the last paragraph of chapter 7?</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Class notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Hume and Rousseau:
<ul>
<li>both give man, in his natural state, some form of beneficience/pity/compassion</li>
<li>Rousseau is rather anti-Enlightenment - he claims that civilization corrupts man from his natural state,
whereas Hume very much buys into the narrative of progress</li>
</ul></li>
<li>By Rousseau's time, Geneva had "degraded" somewhat, so to speak - only very few, rather rich people held power. It had
turned into a Protestant oligarchy, almost</li>
<li>His writing has a general theme that man began as good, but become evil through the emergence of a rationalized structure of humans
that we call "civilization"
<ul>
<li>In this sense, his philosophy is quite opposite to those that came before him, likely due to his biographical experiences</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We come into life with equipment to live life happily, but when wrongly used, can lead us into misery</li>
<li>Rousseau focuses on desire, not obligations or rights or property, very different than others we have read</li>
</ul>

<h2>Quotes</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains. He who believes himself the master of others does not escape being more of a slave
than they.</p>

<p>Renouncing one's liberty is renouncing one's dignity as a man, the rights of humanity, and even its duties. There is no possible compensation
for one who renounces everything. Such a renounciation is incompatible with the nature of man.</p>

<p>I will end this chapter and this book with a remark that should serve as a basis for every social system. It is that instead of destroying
natural equality, the fundamental compact, on the contrary, substitutes a moral and legitimate equality to whatever physical inequality nature
may have been able to impose upon men, and that, however unequal in force or intelligence they may be, men all become equal by agreement
and by right.</p>
