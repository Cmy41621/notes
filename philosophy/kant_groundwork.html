<h1>Notes on: Kant's <em>Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals</em></h1>

<h2>Raw notes</h2>

<p><strong>introduction</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Judgements:
<ul>
<li>Analytic judgements
<ul>
<li>judgements that are essentially true by definition, i.e. explaining the meaning of a term</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Synthetic judgements
<ul>
<li>opposite of analytic; "synthesized" in experience</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A priori (a <em>way</em> we know a judgement is true)
<ul>
<li>a judgement whose truth is known independent of any particular experience</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A posteriori (a <em>way</em> we know a judgement is true)
<ul>
<li>a judgement whose truth is known from experience</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Note that an analytically known judgement is a priori true, but there is no such thing as a judgment that is
analytic and a posteriori true, as we do not need experience to explain definitions</li>
<li>Synthetic a priori judgement is one that tells us something new, but independent of experience -- i.e. reasoning</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>preface</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>(Ancient Greek) philosophy is divided into physics, ethics, and logic</li>
<li>All cognition is either material or formal.
<ul>
<li>material cognition relates to determinate objects, etc. and is split up into <em>physics</em> and <em>ethics</em></li>
<li>formal cognition concerns itself with universal rules of thinking, etc. and is the realm of <em>logic</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Philosophy that presents its claims independent from experience is called pure philosophy
<ul>
<li>pure philosophy can contain judgements that are important to the physical world. For example, although
the fact that certain equations of physics govern our world is not part of pure philosophy, the mathematical
manipulations of ideas in order to derive those equations is purely formal (a priori)</li>
<li>Kant splits the applicable pure philosophy into metaphysics of nature and metaphysics of morals. In some
sense, Kant's metaphysics of nature refers to the mathematical/logical underpinnings of physics and his metaphysics
of morals is <em>moral science</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Kant asks whether philosophy should follow other occupations into dividing labor, i.e. metaphysics vs. physics, formal
vs. material -- he is interested in how far one can get via pure reason alone</li>
<li>Kant emphasizes the necessity for a pure moral philosophy, one not tainted by some empirical/anthropological facts.
<ul>
<li>The existence of such a philosophy, Kant argues, is "clear from the common idea of duty and of moral laws"; everyone
admits that if a law holds morally, it must "carry with it absolute necessity," not only for humans,
but also for <em>any rational creature,</em> and so morality should be judged not from experience, but "a
priori solely in concepts of pure reason"</li>
<li>Thus moral law is very different that practical law</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Though a human may know the pure moral law, he may not find it easy to incorporate into life, due to "inclinations"</li>
<li>Not only must we act in accordance to the moral law, we must act in accordance with in for its own sake
in order for us to be moral</li>
<li>Kant criticizes those who have developed pure moral philosophies that are not based off of particular "pure" wills,
and instead "willing generally", wills that may not necessarily have been in accordance with Kant's
pure will. Kant claims that these general wills are often drawn largely from psychology, and not pure reason;
theorizers of such philosophies neglect the <em>origin</em> of concepts (empirical instead of pure)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>actual text</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Kant claims that the only truely, purely good thing is <em>good will</em>
<ul>
<li>Other things that we often call good (virtues, etc.) can be used for evil intentions</li>
<li>Good will in itself is valuable: "like a jewel, it would still shine by itself, as something that has full</li>
<li>Kant removes all importance of utility from the picture
worth in itself" (p.10)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Kant believes that Nature has assigned "Reason to our will as its ruler"</li>
<li>Kant treats Nature as an agent in its totality -- why? Why would Nature act in a certain way as opposed to another,
if Nature is all that is, with no external imposing structure; introducing Nature as an agent seems to raise more
problems than it solves)? Also, isn't Kant essentially then returning to the utilitarian viewpoint, since Nature
acts in a way such that its agents seek to maximize their happiness, etc.?</li>
<li>Kant claims that in harboring a more cultivated reasoning, we are more unlikely to be truly happy.
Unfortunately, this is a wide blanket statement, and Kant gives no firm argument for this (p.11)</li>
<li>But then, right after that (p.12), he argues that although reason is "not sufficiently fit to guide the will
reliably with regard to its objects and the satisfaction of all our needs", "reason as a practical faculty,
i.e. as one that is meant to influence the wil, has yet been imparted to us, its true function must be to
produce a will that is good, not for other purposes as a means, but good in itself -- for which reason was
absolutely necessary -- since nature has everywhere else gone to work purposively in distributing its
predispositions." (p.12)</li>
<li>Kant is very unclear here about whether theres a distinction between different types of reason (practical vs.
good/true) or whether there is a difference between reason influencing the will and reason influencing
"objects and the satisfaction of all our needs". The second one seems to be his argument, I think, but if reason
can influence the will to be good, does it not indirectly satisfy all our needs, by definition of good will?
What exactly does Kant mean by "reason as a practical faculty"?</li>
<li>Kant claims that the concept of duty is that of the good will, "though under certain subjective limitations
and hindrances, which, however, far from concealing it and making it unrecognizable, rather bring it out by
contrast, and make it shine forth all the more brightly."</li>
<li>An good action must not only seem to conform with duty, but also be done for duty and not a self-serving
purpose.
<ul>
<li>An example Kant gives of a duty is that of preserving one's life.</li>
<li>To secure one's happiness is one's duty</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Where do our duties come from? Who assigns us them/why do we do so?
<ul>
<li>Again, Kant seems to switch into rather utilitarian vocabularly: "But, even without taking note of duty,
all human beings have already of their own the most powerful an intimate inclination to happiness, as it
is just in this idea that all inclinations unite in one sum" (p.14)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Kant states that many things should be done "from duty", such as preserving ones life and being beneficient
where one can, etc. Where does he get these? Why are these duties, and not other things? For one who is trying to
systematize moral philosophy, he's making an awful lot of statements that he doesn't back up.</li>
<li>Actions only have moral worth when they are performed for duty, Kant claims. But what use is moral worth? This kinda
goes back to the previous question, but Kant doesn't seem to give reasons as to why actions with moral
worth are necessarily "better" than others</li>
<li>Kant claims that "an action from duty has its moral worth not in the purpose that is to be attained by it,
but in the maxim according to which it is resolved upon..." (p.15)</li>
<li>"Duty is the necessity of an action from respect for the law" (p.16)
<ul>
<li>What is the form of such laws such that duties derived from them are wholly good?
<ul>
<li>Such laws must be extendable to <em>universal laws</em></li>
<li>In other words, we must act under laws that we would like others to follow as well</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>I don't understand Kant's argument on page 18 about lying. He claims that there can be no universal
law to lie because then "there would actually be no promise at all". What's wrong with this? There never
was a promise for the individual in the first place, as it was false. Is the concept of promise too
valuable to have everyone throw it away? Or is it just that we'd get lied back to if everyone lied,
which is for some reason fundamentally wrong? I can see how it might be undesirable, but Kant would
argue that human desires are worthless, and it is only that which is morally defensible that has any worth...
which yields circular logic...</li>

<h2>My questions</h2>

<p>Why is Kant trying to wholly abstract away the humanity that surrounds morals? In asserting that there
should be a pure moral philosophy, he claims that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Everyone must admit that a law, if it is to hold morally,
i.e. as a ground of an obligation, must carry with it absolute necessity; that the command: thou shalt not lie,
does not just hold for human beings only, as if other rational beings did not have to heed it; and so with all remaining
actual moral laws; hence that the ground of the obligation here must not be sought in the nature of the human being,
or in the circumstances of the world in which he is placed, but a priori solely in concepts of pure reason, and
that any other prescription that is founded on principles of mere experience - and even a prescription that
is in some certain respect universal, in so far as it relies in the least part on empirical grounds, perhaps just for a
motivating ground - can indeed by called a practical rule, but never a moral law." (p. 5) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What do we gain from using such moral philosophy that we do not gain from a moral philosophy that considers only
all of mankind? Furthermore, why does Kant assume that there must exist a pure moral law in the first place? His
only motivation is that "everyone must admit that a law... must carry with it absolute necessity." It is not at all clear
that the fact that it is a consistent statement to say "A moral law carries necessity" implies the existence of such a law.
In mathematics, for example, one can define what one means by "greatest common divisor" in some arbitrary number system, but that two
arbitrary numbers always have such a number <em>must be proved</em>. We must prove rigorously an existence theorem before
using the idea of gcd lest we find that the beautiful properties of the gcd are useless, as such an object does not exist!
In fact, Kant's claim here seems almost entirely based off of a definition of his own making, and so I am thoroughly
unconvinced.</p>
