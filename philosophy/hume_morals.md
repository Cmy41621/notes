Notes on: Hume's *[An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals](http://www.anselm.edu/homepage/dbanach/hume-enquiry%20concerning%20morals.htm#sec1)*
========================================

## Raw notes ##

* When it comes to controversies of principle, it is not worth arguing with those who are "obstinate in their principles" and those
    who "do not believe the opinions they defend"
* A controversy that *is* worth examining is one that concerns the "general foundation of Morals": are morals derived from "Reason" or "Sentiment"?
* Why do we care? Morals teach us our duties and discern virtue/vice
* To determine from whence morals do indeed come, Hume takes an experimental tactic: "we shall analyse that complication of mental qualities, which form what,
    in common life, we call Personal Merit" and determine how these qualities engender esteem/contempt, etc.
* Language itself is heavily laden with "judgement", with words that are taken in "good sense" or not
* We must appeal to reason to correctly determine the facts ("circumstances"), i.e. to connect the qualities to their effects
* It is obvious that *benevolent* qualities are "good": take the example of a ruler. If the ruler has skill in government, people may respect him, etc.
    but be envious of his success. If the ruler is benevolent - humane and beneficient, lenient and tender in his power - "envy itself is silent"
* For those lacking in such an elevated societal position, such benevolence becomes even more requisite, as there is less to compensate, less to
    preserve the individual from contempt, etc.
* At least part of the merit of benevolent qualities stems from their *utility*, to both one's self and others
* Benevolence's merits stem from its tendency to bestow happiness on society
* Justice is, by construction, that which promotes public utility, and is thus unquestionably meritorious
* Given an abundance of external conveniences - i.e. everything one wants - justice would not be required
* That which is available in great abundance is never partitioned: it is left "in common along the whole human race"
* If benevolence were much deeper than it is found in society today, justice would again be rendered unnecessary, as one would consider others simply
    as a "second self". It is precisely this principle upon which the "family" rests
* In an environment of complete scarcity, what role does justice play now? It must change radically, as what may have previously been disallowed may
    now be necessary for the survival of society
* However, most of modern society rests in between these two extremes, and thus justice does indeed become necessary

> For if we can be so happy, in the course of this enquiry, as to discover the true origin of morals, it will then easily appear how far either sentiment or reason enters into all determinations of this nature. In order to attain this purpose, we shall endeavour to follow a very simple method: we shall analyse that complication of mental qualities, which form what, in common life, we call Personal Merit: we shall consider every attribute of the mind, which renders a man an object either of esteem and affection, or of hatred and contempt; every habit or sentiment or faculty, which, if ascribed to any person, implies either praise or blame, and may enter into any panegyric or satire of his character and manners.

> Men are now cured of their passion for hypotheses and systems in natural philosophy, and will hearken to no arguments but those which are derived from experience. It is full time they should attempt a like reformation in all moral disquisitions; and reject every system of ethics, however subtle or ingenious, which is not founded on fact and observation. 

> It must, indeed, be confessed, that by doing good only, can a man truly enjoy the advantages of being eminent. His exalted station, of itself but the more exposes him to danger and tempest. His sole prerogative is to afford shelter to inferiors, who repose themselves under his cover and protection. 

> As these topics of praise never fail to be employed, and with success, where we would inspire esteem for any one; may it not thence be concluded, that the utility, resulting from the social virtues, forms, at least, a PART of their merit, and is one source of that approbation and regard so universally paid to them?

> In general, what praise is implied in the simple epithet USEFUL! What reproach in the contrary!

> If any false opinion, embraced from appearances, has been found to prevail; as soon as farther experience and sounder reasoning have given us juster notions of human affairs, we retract our first sentiment, and adjust anew the boundaries of moral good and evil.

> We see, even in the present necessitous condition of mankind, that, wherever any benefit is bestowed by nature in an unlimited abundance, we leave it always in common among the whole human race, and make no subdivisions of right and property.
 
> Produce extreme abundance or extreme necessity: Implant in the human breast perfect moderation and humanity, or perfect rapaciousness and malice: By rendering justice totally USELESS, you thereby totally destroy its essence, and suspend its obligation upon mankind. The common situation of society is a medium amidst all these extremes. We are naturally partial to ourselves, and to our friends; but are capable of learning the advantage resulting from a more equitable conduct. Few enjoyments are given us from the open and liberal hand of nature; but by art, labour, and industry, we can extract them in great abundance. Hence the ideas of property become necessary in all civil society: Hence justice derives its usefulness to the public: And hence alone arises its merit and moral obligation.
