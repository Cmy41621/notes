Notes on: Burke's *Reflections on the Revolution in France*
========================================

## Raw notes ##

* Any virtue in the abstract is to fickle to deal with; one must take into account the circumstances of a situation
before praising or blaming said virtue. Burke thus criticizes those who blindly support any revolution or drastic
action for the ideal itself.
* Burke seems to be writing this book to warn the English not to get too idealistic about "liberty," etc.
* Burke also seems a bit opposed to the proliferation of myriad opposing political views (see second quote) and,
perhaps in some sense the freedom of speech.
* Burke believes that the structures of government are not to be trifled with (p. 21): "Otherwise competence and power
would soon be confounded, and no law be left but the will of a prevailing force". This seems to be another
reason that Burke does not find revolutionary ideas attractive: he believes that humans, in the absence of a
power structure with historical precedence/authority, will disintegrate into a power struggle.
    * Structures of govt may not "dissolve" each other
* Burke uses this argument to justify the English monarchy; something along the lines of
"it has precedence and it works." Burke cannot conceive of trying to change the government in various ways in
order to reach a more perfect state -- he seems to believe that the necessary transition states would descend into
chaos
* The characteristic property of *property* is that it is unequal -- it belongs solely to one.
* Burke emphasizes the naturality of fearing God, looking up at kings in awe, etc. and claims that
all other feelings are simply false and spurious
* Burke questions the seeming necessity of the revolution; was the monarchy really wholly impossible to improve
and reform without tearing down the whole fabric of the governemnt (and replacing it with an experiment form)

> But I cannot stand forward, and give praise or blame to any thing which relates to human actions, and human concerns, on
a simple view of the object, as it stands stripped of every relation, in all the nakedness and solitude of metaphysical
abstraction. Circumstances give in reality to every political principle its distinguishing color and discriminating
effect.

> His zeal is of a curious character... It is not for the propagation of his own opinions, but of any opinions. It is not
for the diffusion of truth, but for the spreading of contradiction.

> A state without the means of some change is without the means of its conservation.

> No government could stand a moment, if it could be blown down with any thing so loose and indefinite as an opinion
of 'misconduct.'
